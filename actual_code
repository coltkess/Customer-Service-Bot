# Customer-Service-Bot

#Codecademy project. The assignment was to create a customer service bot to their specifications.

#The overarching function for the assignment is called cs_service_bot(), this is the main prompt:
def cs_service_bot():
    print("Hello! Welcome to the DNS Cable Company's Service Portal. Are you a new or existing customer? \n [1] New Customer \n [2] Existing Customer")
    response = input("Please enter the number corresponding to your choice: ")
    if response == "1":
        new_customer()
    elif response == "2":
        existing_customer()
    else:
        print("Sorry, we didn't understand your selection.")
        cs_service_bot()
        
#Second function -- an offshoot of the first. If the customer responds with a 2 in the initial function, they come here:
def existing_customer():
    print("What kind of support do you need? \n [1] Television Support \n [2] Internet Support \n [3] Speak to a support representative.")
    response = input("Please enter the number corresponding to your choice: ")
    if response == "1":
        television_support()
    elif response == "2":

    elif response == "3":
        live_rep(support)
    else:
        print("Sorry, we didn't understand your selection.")
        existing_customer()

#Third Function -- an offshoot of cs_service_bot(). If the customer responds with a  1 in the initial function, they land here:
def new_customer():
    print("We're excited to have you join the DNS family, how can we help you? \n [1] Sign up for service \n [2] Schedule a home visit. \n [3] Speak to a sales representative.")
    response = input("Please enter the number corresponding to your choice: ")

        live_rep("sales")
    else:
        print("Sorry, we didn't understand your selection.")
        new_customer()
        
#Fourth function -- for those existing customers with TV issues. So the path is cs_service_bot > existing_customer > this
